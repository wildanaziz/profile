# Energy Efficiency Building Prediction

## Project Overview
This machine learning project focuses on predicting the heating and cooling load requirements of buildings based on their structural characteristics, helping architects and engineers design more energy-efficient buildings.

## Dataset
The dataset includes 768 building samples with 8 features:
- Relative Compactness
- Surface Area
- Wall Area
- Roof Area
- Overall Height
- Orientation
- Glazing Area
- Glazing Area Distribution

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Correlation analysis to identify key features
- Train-test split (80-20 ratio)

### Models Implemented
1. **Linear Regression** - Baseline model
2. **Random Forest Regressor** - Best performing model
3. **Gradient Boosting** - Alternative ensemble method
4. **Neural Network** - Deep learning approach

## Results

### Model Performance
- **Random Forest**: R² score of 0.98
- **Gradient Boosting**: R² score of 0.97
- **Neural Network**: R² score of 0.96
- **Linear Regression**: R² score of 0.92

### Key Insights
- Glazing area has the highest impact on energy efficiency
- Overall height and relative compactness are strong predictors
- Ensemble methods significantly outperform linear models

## Real-World Applications
- **Building Design**: Help architects optimize for energy efficiency
- **Retrofit Planning**: Identify buildings that need energy improvements
- **Cost Estimation**: Predict energy costs for new constructions
- **Sustainability**: Reduce carbon footprint of buildings

## Technologies Used
```python
- Python 3.9
