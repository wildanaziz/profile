## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// Type-safe API client with React Query
const useStudentProgress = () => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['progress'],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const { data } = await api.get('/api/v1/students/progress');
      return progressSchema.parse(data);
    },
  });
};

// Form handling with validation
const createTestSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(5),
  duration: z.number().min(30).max(240),
  questions: z.array(questionSchema),
});
```

### Backend API Design (Go)
```go
// RESTful API with clean architecture
type StudentService interface {
    GetProgress(ctx context.Context, studentID uint) (*dto.Progress, error)
    CreateStudyPlan(ctx context.Context, plan *dto.CreatePlanRequest) error
}

// Handler with proper error handling
func (h *StudentHandler) GetProgress(c *gin.Context) {
    studentID := c.GetUint("studentID")
    progress, err := h.service.GetProgress(c.Request.Context(), studentID)
    if err != nil {
        c.JSON(500, gin.H{"error": "Failed to fetch progress"})
        return
    }
    c.JSON(200, progress)
}
```

### AI Integration (Gemini)
```go
// AI Tutor Service
type AITutorService struct {
    client *genai.Client
    model  *genai.GenerativeModel
}

func (s *AITutorService) AskQuestion(ctx context.Context, question string) (string, error) {
    prompt := fmt.Sprintf(`Anda adalah tutor UTBK yang membantu siswa SMA Indonesia.
    Pertanyaan: %s
    Berikan penjelasan yang mudah dipahami dalam Bahasa Indonesia.`, question)
    
    resp, err := s.model.GenerateContent(ctx, genai.Text(prompt))
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    return formatResponse(resp), nil
}
```
